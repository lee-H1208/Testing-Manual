# Introduction
Glass is a newly developed, experimental <u>dashboard</u> that supports many types of widgets. Some of these widgets are supported by the Simulation GUI, but there are some others, including:
1. [Sendable Chooser](#sendable-chooser)
2. [PID Controller](#pid-controller)
3. [FMSInfo](#fmsinfo)

## What is a Dashboard?
A dashboard is a visual representation of your data. 

Previously, we used shuffleboard, which is another dashboard that displays NetworkTables data and widgets that can be initialized and created by robot code.

## What is the difference between Shuffleboard and Glass?
Shuffleboard is more drive-team centric, meaning that it is a dashboard mainly used on the field during an actual competition game. 

Glass, on the other hand, is developed with programming debugging in mind. Several components of glass support this claim:
1. Command-Based Widgets
2. Viewing Robot Trajectories
3. Viewing Robot Pose
